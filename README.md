# Fire-Non-Fire Detection Model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview:
This repository contains the implementation of a Fire-Non-Fire detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained to classify images into two classes: Fire and Non-Fire.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of a collection of images containing both fire and non-fire scenarios. The dataset was carefully curated to ensure diversity and representativeness.

## Model Architecture:
The CNN architecture employed for this task comprises multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction. Subsequently, fully connected layers are utilized for classification.

## Training:
The model was trained on a portion of the dataset using appropriate optimization techniques and loss functions to minimize classification errors and maximize accuracy.

## Evaluation:
The trained model was evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance in accurately detecting fire and non-fire scenarios. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were computed to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

## Results:
The model demonstrated promising performance in accurately distinguishing between fire and non-fire images, as evidenced by the evaluation metrics.
